If you allude to the meaning, Aatmnirbhar means "self dependent" in English. Then you ask "whom do you want to be Aatmnirbhar ?" , "What kinds of problems it gonna solve?" , "Why do we need it", " How did you developed it? And so many curious questions. Don't worry, here we answer all our queries.
This webapp "Aatmnirbhar" is dedicated to all the college students  who come across so many problems in their busy college life and sometimes, we as a student  feel "Oh god ! With this huge mountains of Tasks , Events , Lectures , Projects, Quiz , don't I deserve a manager who manages my work and reminds me of the same"
Yes, you do deserve, that is why we have developed this amazing webapp for you. It allows you to create a task and reminds you to get it  completed in time. This "Calendar Feature" is one of the basic features of our webapp. We tried to make it very customized and have many USP features like, we have different attendance policy across different colleges so, a user can enter his/her scheme and this webapp will make sure you meet your need. In future releases, we plan to make a network of friends and an automated request kind of message asking for proxy will be sent.
